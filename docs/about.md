## An ethical society

SixFoisSept is a company built on two fundamentals. Technical excellence in DataScience methods and tools on the one hand and ethics on the other.

We built the SixFoisSept project by writing Data For Good into our DNA. We carry out our projects on a fair, ethical basis and without black boxes. We invest part of our profits in causes that we believe are right (the fight against cancer for years or the program of access to school for disadvantaged children “Freedom Through Education” in Nepal).

SixFoisSept is a signatory of the “Hippocratic Oath for DataScience” charter.
